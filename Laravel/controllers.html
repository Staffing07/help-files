<h2>Controllers</h2>
<p>Rather than handling what happens with the data directly in the routes file, it is cleaner and easier to manage to have a controller setup to handle requests in different ways.</p>
<p>Can either create the file manually or use artisan</p>
<p>In terminal type...</p>
<p>php artisan make:controller NameofController</p>
<p>The controller is placed in app/http/Controllers</p>
<p>Create functions in the class</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Full example of a linking route -> controller -></h3>
<h4>Route (web.php)</h4>
<code>
Route::get('/recipes', 'RecipeController@index');

Route::get('/recipes/{id}', 'RecipeController@show');
</code>
<p>The route will fire when the matching url is requested by the browser.  The 'RecipeController is the name of the controller and the @index or @show is the action within that controller.</p>

<h4>Contoller app/http/Controllers</h4>
<code>
class RecipeController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        // get data from database
        // pass data as an array into the view
        $pizzas = [
            'type' => 'hawaiian',
            'base' => 'deep pan',
            'cuisine' => 'Italian'
        ];

        return view('recipes', [
            'pizzas' => $pizzas,
        ]);
    }

    public function show($id)
    {
        // use the $id variable to query the db for a record
        return view('details', ['id' => $id]);
    }
}
</code>
<p>Some of the controller file is created automatically when created by artisan.</p>
<p>Index and show are the names of the actions that link back to the routes.</p>
<p>The return view('recipes') tells the code which view file to open e.g. this one is resources/views/recipes and resources/views/details</p>
