<h2>Eloquent models</h2>
<p>Rather than manually typing SQL, Laravel uses models that it then wraps up in SQL code.</p>
<p>Each model can have several code methods to add, edit or remove data.</p>
<h3>Creating an eloquent model</h3>
<p>php artisan make:model Modelname</p>
<p>php artisan make:model Pizza</p>
<p>The models are saved in app folder</p>
<p>The model name should be plurasized e.g if the table is recipes call the model php artisan make:model recipe</p>
