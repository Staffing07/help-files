<h3>How does a Laravel site work?</h3>
<p>Request from url comes in</p>
<p>If a route file matches the Url requested, this route file will tell the browser what to do next. </p>
<p>This could be something like, modify a database in some way, retrieve data or display a page.</p>
<p>Then the view is compiled and returned to the browser.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Users page requested in url</li>
    <li>Route file matching users runs code to get users list from database and then render it using a view to a page for the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Laravel files</h3>
<h4>routes/web.php</h4>
<p>This file shows all potential urls with their return views that are in the resource/views folder.</p>
<p>These views are templates, so think of them as the page layout with placeholders for other things in them.</p>
<code>
    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('welcome');
    });
</code>
<p>This route will trigger the homepage view.</p>
<p>The 'welcome' accesses the resources/views/welcome blade layout</p>
<code>
    Route::get('/recipes', function () {
        return view('welcome');
    });
</code>
<p>This route will trigger the recipes view.</p>
<h4>Route return types</h4>
<p>You can return different types</p>
<code>
    Route::get('/recipes', function () {
        return 'recipes';
    });
</code>
<p>This would return a page showing plain text/html with the word recipes rather than using a view file.</p>
<code>
    Route::get('/recipes', function () {
        return ['name' => 'tomato soup', 'ingredient' => 'tomatoes'];
    });
</code>
<p>This would return a json string object.</p>
<h4>Using blade to pass data from the route file to the view</h4>
<code>
    Route::get('/recipes', function () {
        return view('recipes', ['cuisine' => 'Indian' ]);
    });
</code>
<p>The above example will return the recipes view when the user visits /recipes.  We are also passing an array through to the view using the variable 'cuisine'</p>
<p>In the view file we could then type {{ $cuisine }} to pull that data value into the view file</p>
<p>The double curly braces also escapes any special characters.</p>
<p>A more complex array</p>
<code>
$pizzas = [
    ['type' => 'hawaiian', 'base' => 'cheesy crust'],
    ['type' => 'volcano', 'base' => 'garlic crust'],
    ['type' => 'veg supreme', 'base' => 'thin & crispy crust']</code>
